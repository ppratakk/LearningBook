# DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle
> *The Dependency Inversion principle states that our classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions*

Based on this idea, Robert C. Martinâ€™s definition of the Dependency Inversion Principle consists of two parts:
1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

2. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
