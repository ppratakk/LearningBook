It is as simple as it sounds which means that a class should only perform a single job not the multiple jobs in a same class. This approach prevents the creation of  _“God objects”_  – objects that “_know too much or do too much_“.

The classes you write, should not be a swiss army knife. They should do one thing, and to that one thing well.
